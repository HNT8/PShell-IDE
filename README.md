# PShell-IDE
Powershell IDE (kinda)

Basic powershell IDE I was experimenting with for someone. It's not functional. It only has the basic UI required for it to be a functional IDE. Feel free to do whatever you want with this. Just please give credit to <b>[hlpdev](https://github.com/hlpdev)</b> :)
